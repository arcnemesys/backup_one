I started Lambda mid 2018, switched from WebPt2 to fulltime during, and worked 3 TL gigs between April '19 and Oct '20, and 1 SL gig in Feb '21. I completed Endorsement and graduated in Aug '20 in the middle of the pandem. At this time I was self-studying mathematics, which I always hated and felt naturally untalented at, but came to love through CS/programming. Eventually I incorporated physics, which I'd always loved but felt wasn't an option due math being a barrier. I was posting about it online, ended up getting some traction, started doing Interintellect salons about it in the early days, and posting notes, etc. I was talking to a friend about how I'd spoken to people at JPL/IBM in their job pipelines who liked the story but couldn't hire me due to lack of a degree/being enrolled in one  Posting about that online, shortly before my graduation, the pandemic hit, and I had to move from Ohio to Oregon to get out of the environment I was in.
