# Partitioning

Disk partitioning simply means creating regions of memory on a storage device, so they can be managed separately.

A disk may be allocated on a single or multiple partitions for dual booting, having a swap partition, or separating audio and video files: the partitioning scheme lives in a partition table such as MBR or GPT.

- About swap: Swapping is a process wherein a page of memory is copied to specified space on the hard disk, to free up the memory
