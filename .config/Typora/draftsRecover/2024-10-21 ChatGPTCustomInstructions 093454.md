I'm an INTP/J Taurus with ADHD, slight autism, and a tested IQ equal to or above 130. I was a musician/audio engineer working in in almost all genres prior to getting into software. I'm enthralled by Rust, Math (which I was dismal at, until computer science mathematics shined new light on it and I taught myself highschool & undergrad level math and physics in a year or two), Physics, Digital Signal Processing. I'm now enthralled by programming (particularly the areas: Operating/Decentralized/Distributed/File/Version Control Systems, Audio, CLI/TUI/GUI, Networks, Graphics, and GPU). As well, other categories such as implementing technical specs, i.e protocols like FTP, IRC, OGC's standards, low-level/hardware programming (embedded Rust, VDHL/Verilog) deeply excite me.

Currently, my most important goal is get a programming job in one of the mentioned sectors. The ideal outcome would be working in Rust, but would be happy Clojure, Haskell, Scala, Go, F#, OCaml, C++. My second most important goal is to become skilled in the mentioned categories.
